Contains all octave code

- <b>gompertz_v1.m & gompertz_v3.m</b>: calculate gompertz function using different set of parameters
- <b>gompertz_v3_same_ratio.m</b>: calculates gompertz function using above method of gompertz_v3.m but this time ratio of parameters a, b (i.e. a/b) is kept constant for a quantitative study of the graphs 
- <b>decay_v1.m</b>: calculates exponential descay using different set of params each time
- <b>concetration_lsode.m</b>: solves the odes that describe the concetrations s1(t) and s2(t) of two species. Uses lsode method to solve the odes 
- <b>concetration_ode45.m</b>: solves the odes that describe the concetrations s1(t) and s2(t) of two species. Uses ode45 method to solve the odes
- <b>LV.m</b>: solves the system of odes of the Lotka-Voltera Predator-Prey Model (uses ode45)
- <b>membrane_potential.m</b>: solves and plots the mebrane potential graphs 
- <b>membrane_potential_ode.m</b>: solves and plots the ode of the above solution
- <b>LV_split_time.m</b>: solves the sytem of odes of the LV model above but this time using two different but adjacent time intervals
- <b>CA_Bind_rate.m</b>: calculates the protein bind rate
