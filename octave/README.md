Contains all octave code

- gompertz_v1.m & gompertz_v3.m: calculate gompertz function using different set of parameters
- gompertz_v3_same_ratio.m: calculates gompertz function using above method of gompertz_v3.m but this time ratio of parameters a, b (i.e. a/b) is kept constant for a quantitative study of the graphs 
- decay_v1.m: calculates exponential descay using different set of params each time
- concetration_lsode.m: solves the odes that describe the concetrations s1(t) and s2(t) of two species. Uses lsode method to solve the odes 
- concetration_ode45.m: solves the odes that describe the concetrations s1(t) and s2(t) of two species. Uses ode45 method to solve the odes
- LV.m: solves the system of odes of the Lotka-Voltera Predator-Prey Model (uses ode45)
- membrane_potential.m: solves and plots the mebrane potential graphs 
- membrane_potential_ode.m: solves and plots the ode of the above solution
- LV_split_time.m : solves the sytem of odes of the LV model above but this time using two different but adjacent time intervals
- CA_Bind_rate.m calculates the bind rate
